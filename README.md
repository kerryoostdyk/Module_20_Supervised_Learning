# Module_20_Supervised_Learning

In this activity, I applied machine learning models using the SciKit-Learn library. I loaded and evaluated the dataset, applied standard scaling, and split the data into training and testing sets. I then implemented a classification function for model training.

I tested the dataset with multiple models, including:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest Classifier
Extra Trees Classifier
AdaBoost Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
XGBoost Classifier

After evaluating the results, I found that logistic regression provided the best fit for the data. It performed competitively  with complex models while remaining interpretable.

The logistic regression model predicted 86 false positives (healthy loans misclassified as high-risk) and 11 false negatives (high-risk loans misclassified as healthy). The dataset is highly imbalanced, with 97% of the data labeled as '0' (healthy loans), which likely contributed to the higher number of false positives.

Despite this imbalance, the logistic regression model achieved an AUC score of 0.997, indicating a strong fit. While some other models performed similarly, they were more complex and less explainable than logistic regression.
